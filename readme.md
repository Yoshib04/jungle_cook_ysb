### for refrence for fire base:

my code does in fact work with firebase for me on my end im not sure why it doesnt seem to work on web 4. I have attached screenshots in the comments of my submission showcasing all the other parts which are needed to run for the project.

also the logo for the header image is already cut off in the svg making it look cut off because of my code. ill show a ss of that to.
